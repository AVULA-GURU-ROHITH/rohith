Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya</font><br> or
<b>Rasvidya. <br><u>It included metallurgy, medicine,</b>
manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc.</u>
Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in
Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the
story of development of chemistry in India
is very old.</p> Archaeological findings show
that baked bricks were used in construction
work. It shows the mass production of
pottery, <p>which can be regarded as the earliest
chemical process, in which materials were
mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by
using fire to achieve desirable qualities.
Remains of glazed pottery have been found in
Mohenjodaro. </p>Gypsum cement has been used
in the construction work. It contains lime,
sand and traces of CaCO3.<strike> Harappans made
faience, a sort of glass which was used in
ornaments.</strike> They melted and forged a variety
of objects from metals, such as lead, silver,
gold and copper.</p>

<p> They improved the hardness
of copper for making artefacts by using tin
and arsenic. A number of glass objects were
found in Maski in South India (1000–900
BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North
India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were
coloured by addition of colouring agents like
